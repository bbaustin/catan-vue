# Catan Dice Roller (Vue)

A couple of years ago, I made a dice roller for playing "Settlers of Catan," after my cat knocked my game's dice into oblivion ([demo](https://hereismy.website/catan-dice-roller/), [code](https://github.com/bbaustin/catan)). That was built with vanilla JavaScript. I decided to build the same thing again, this time using Vue.js. It has an improved (?) design and an extra feature or two. 

You can try this out [here](https://hereismy.website/catan-dice-roller-2/)!
